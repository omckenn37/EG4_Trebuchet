### Top Circle:

</p>


This is the top half of the sphere when assembling. This will contain the pieces that supports the raspberry pi, altimeter, and gyro/accelerometer. The three rectangular prisms are pieces we converted to laser cut peices so we can try to save as much material as we can. All those pieces will be held in place by standoffs and at the bottom screwed in directly into the sphere structure. The right image the slot that the screw will insert in and go threw to the other half of the sphere and screw the together. This is drilled into the sphere so there is nothing perturding from the spherical shape.


### Bottom Circle:

This is the bottom half of the sphere when assembling. This will contain the battery and power booster. The bottom ovalish extruded piece is what will hold the battery it has been made to match the shape with a bit of padding. The piece to the side of that is the holder of the power booster it has been made so it is at an angle so it saves space by optimizing on the curved shape of a sphere. The right image is an extrusion along the inside of the capsule walls it forms a correlating slot that will direct the screw into a gap where we can slide the nut into and screw the capsule together. 





### Assembly:

The first image displays the assembly without the top circle and displays the pi components floating in the air and you can see the screws going into their slots and can see the battery and power booster screwed in under them. The second picture displays the assembly without the bottom circle and shows the screwed in battery and power booster while the pi components are floating and you can see the floating nuts and the screw extruding from its slot. Lastly, the final image is the completed you can see the entire assembly we extruded the sides to make an almost wiffel-ball-like shape so that it saves as much materaila as possible and we also added the screw and nut portion without messing the sphere shape.
