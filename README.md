## CAD
### Top Circle
<img align="right" src="media/TopCircle.png" width="150">
This is the top half of the sphere when assembling. This will contain the pieces that supports the raspberry pi, altimeter, and gyro/accelerometer. The three rectangular prisms are pieces we converted to laser cut peices so we can try to save as much material as we can. All those pieces will be held in place by standoffs and at the bottom screwed in directly into the sphere structure.

This displays the slot that the screw will insert in and go threw to the other half of the sphere and screw the together. This is drilled into the sphere so there is nothing perturding from the spherical shape.

### Bottom Circle

This is the bottom half of the sphere when assembling. This will contain the battery and power booster. The bottom ovalish extruded piece is what will hold the battery it has been made to match the shape with a bit of padding. The piece to the side of that is the holder of the power booster it has been made so it is at an angle so it saves space by optimizing on the curved shape of a sphere.

This is a aspect that is ingrained inside along the capsule walls it pertrudes off to form an shape that will direct the screw into a gap where we can slide the nut into. And screw the capsule together.
