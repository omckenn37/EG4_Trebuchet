### Trebuchet 

#### Trebuchet Basics

<img align="right" src="media/trebuchet_real.jpg" width="250">

Trebuchets are ancient siege weapons that utilize a counterweight to launch a projectile great distances. They are pretty much catapults except they use a counterweight rather than some sort of spring or rubber band. The use of a counterweight allows the payload to cover much greater distances than a traditional catapult; trebuchets also tend to have greater accuracy than catapults. In order to achieve maxium distance, the counterweight must be heavier than the payload. For our purposes, we figure a good starting range would be at least 100 feet; we want to possibly increase this goal to 200-300 feet depending on how initial testing goes. 

#### Trebuchet Physics

In general, they key for getting maxiumum range out of a trebuchet is by finding the right release angle for the pouch and the right mass for the counterweight. Obviously, having a heavier counterweight will increase the range. Finding the right release angle is a bit trickier. Looking at the graphics below, you can see that the component determining the pouch release angle is the finger. If we make the beam the horiziontal axis in relation to the finger, then a positive angle would result in a later release time while a negative angle would result in an earlier release time.

### Payload Capsule

The capsule is going to be a spherical container which will hold the raspberry pi, a breadboard, accelerometer, altimeter, and the Lithium ion Polymer battery and this capsule is the payload of the trebuchet. These components will be wired up and fastened into the structure of the capsule so that they donâ€™t move around and get damaged. The capsule will be wrapped in some sort of foam in order to make the impact with the ground softer for the materials inside.


### Materials

| Material  | Quantity |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Raspberry Pi Zero  | 1 |
| Accelerometer | 1 |
| Altimeter | 1 |
| Lipo Battery | 1 |
| Power booster | 1 |
| USB-A to microUSB power cable | 1 |


### Code 

#### Prep Table

| What?  | Why? | Have we learned this in the assignments? |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Take Acceleration Values  | So we can find the accerlation over time, and find speeds | Yes |
| Find Displacement | know distance,  | No |
| Take Altitude (and Max Altitude) | So we can find the max of the flight | No, but we have an altimeter |
| Find time in air | So we know how long it was in the air | No, but we have the tools |
| Find Max Velocity | know speed/velocity | Yes |
| Calculate Equation Model | So we can graph the flight, and know all we want about the flight/trajectory | No |
| Graph true flight on Webpage | So we can visually represent the flight -- in what it actually looked liked | Yes |
| Graph equation of flight on Webpage | So we can visually represent the flight -- in what the equation it followed looks like (both graphs should be similar) | No |
| Profit | Become a government contractor for Trebuchets| Of Course |

#### Pseudo Pseudo Code
    
      When launch button pressed
            while IN AIR:
            
              Record height, acceleration, time
              sleep( small delay )
              
      
            while Not IN AIR:
              calculate equation model
              graph equation
              put equation on webpage
              put data on webpage



Equation Modeling -- Answer at bottom:

```(x,y) or (distance x interval, height y invterval) or (((time * velocity) / amount of sleep intervals) * interval, height)```

or

```((( total time * (acceleration_x * current time)) / amount of sleep intervals) * interval, height)``` 

or

The Kinematic -- ```dx = vi * t + 1/2 * a * t^2```

so 

total ```dx = 1/2 * a * t^2```

therefore

interval ```dx = (1/2) * ax * t^2 * (current interval / total interval )```


or


```dx = 1/2 * accel_x * t^2``` 

then we substitute the a and t values from each array at each interval. Then, we use that dx as our x, and height as y. Then we plug that x and y into an equation function.
